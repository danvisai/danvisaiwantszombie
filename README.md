# Zombie Hunter
After nightfall, the undead take over the city and no one is safe from them anymore. Only Jimmy Johnson doesn't admit defeat and becomes a zombie hunter in the dark. 

Help him make the city safer and destroy as many zombies as possible. But beware of the slippery roofs. A fall into the depths will kill you.

## What is it?
Zombie Hunter is a classic retro-look platformer game. It requires skill and timing and can be played ideally in between. Currently it is still in an early stage of development. Interesting features are planned for the future :-)

Game mechanics:
* Press the lower left corner of the display to jump (the longer you press the higher Jimmy jumps)
* Press right down on the display to shoot.
* The magazine's got seven bullets, then Jimmy's gotta reload
* Contact with zombies is deadly
